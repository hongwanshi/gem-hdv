# Grid-integrated Electric Mobility model v2.0


## Project description

The Grid-integrated Electric Mobility (GEM) model is an open-source modeling platform developed by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, UC Davis, and UC Berkeley. This modeling system simulates the operation of both the mobility sector and the electricity sector on a national scale in the United States. This GEM v2.0 is an extension of the original [GEM model](https://github.com/LBNL-UCB-STI/gem). This version now has the capability to study impact analysis of human-driven ride-hail, privately owned and SAEVs for LDVs, and human-driven, automated electrified trucks for HDVs, based on automation technologies and electrification on charging profiles and grid management (the extended capacities are circled with red dashline below).
